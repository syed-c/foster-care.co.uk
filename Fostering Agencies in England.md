## **Independent and Local Authority Fostering Agencies in England**

When exploring your options, you’ll notice that fostering support in England comes from two main paths. Each one offers something unique, and the goal is simply to find the path that feels right for you.

### **Independent Fostering Agencies in England**

Independent agencies (often called IFAs) operate separately from local councils. Many IFAs offer:

* Stronger day-to-day support  
* Specialist placements  
* Therapeutic training  
* 24/7 help  
* A close-knit carer community

They can be a good match for people who want hands-on guidance and continuous support.

### **Local Authority Fostering in England**

Local authorities recruit and support carers directly. Some people choose councils because:

* Placements may be closer to children’s home areas  
* They want direct involvement with children’s services  
* They prefer council-led support systems

Both independent agencies and local authorities play important roles. What matters is choosing the one that feels comfortable and supportive for your home.

## **Types of Fostering in England**

Fostering needs vary across the country. Different children require different types of care, and each type lets you use your strengths in a meaningful way.

### **Short-Term and Long-Term Fostering**

Short-term fostering supports children during transitions, while long-term fostering provides stability until adulthood or independence.

### **Emergency and Respite Fostering**

Emergency fostering helps children who need immediate safety. Respite fostering gives families short breaks to recharge and continue offering strong care.

### **Therapeutic and Specialist Fostering**

These placements support children with higher emotional or behavioural needs. Agencies offer strong training and wraparound support for carers in these roles.

### **Parent and Child Fostering**

You support a young parent and their baby, helping them build stability and develop parenting skills within your home.
